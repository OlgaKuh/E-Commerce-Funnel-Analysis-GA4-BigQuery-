# E-Commerce Funnel Analysis (GA4 + BigQuery)

This project showcases a funnel analysis using SQL and GA4 data stored in Google BigQuery for an e-commerce platform. The goal is to understand user behavior across key steps in the purchase journey and identify opportunities to improve conversion rates.

## üîç Project Overview

The analysis includes:

1. **Data Cleaning & Processing**  
   Preparing raw GA4 data for analysis and BI reporting.

2. **Conversions by Date and Traffic Channel**  
   Calculating daily conversion rates segmented by traffic source.

3. **Landing Page Conversion Comparison**  
   Identifying high- and low-performing landing pages based on conversions.

4. **User Engagement vs Purchase Correlation**  
   Measuring the relationship between user activity (views, scrolls, clicks) and purchase behavior.

## üõ† Tools & Technologies
- SQL (Standard SQL in BigQuery)
- Google Analytics 4 (GA4)
- Google BigQuery
- BI Reporting (e.g., Tableau or Looker Studio ‚Äî optional mention if used)

## üßæ Dataset Used

This analysis uses Google‚Äôs public GA4 sample dataset:

**`bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce`**

This dataset simulates real-world e-commerce tracking using Google Analytics 4 and is publicly available in Google BigQuery.
